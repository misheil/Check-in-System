# RestartCheckIn

Hey fellas: Mishiel, Irene, Ivas
here is our Boiler Plate, all you need to do is clone this respository and after that run npm install to install dependencies for Node JS and React, i already added eveything we need to package.json.
also SQL is set with MiddleWares.
Here you have also 3 diffrent branches one is Master, try to avoid pushing anything to it before the final edit.
And others are Students and Admin, which you can commit your files in this branches.

Good Luck!
